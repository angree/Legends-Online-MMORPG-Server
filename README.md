# Legends-Online-MMORPG-Server

This is my old project I was playing with in 2009 and 2010. It involves simple MMORPG game, that allows you to explore few maps and kill some monsters. There is an inventory/equipment/eatable systems and a loot system. You can cast offensive spell, (3 and arrow), healing spell (7 and arrow) or pick up drop while standing in mob's body (6 and arrow). 9 opens up inventory.
